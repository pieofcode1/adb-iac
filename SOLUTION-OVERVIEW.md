# Unity Catalog Multi-Workspace Solution - Complete Package

## 🎯 **Solution Overview**

This repository now provides a **complete, production-ready solution** for Azure Databricks with Unity Catalog, showcasing the power of cross-workspace data sharing and centralized governance.

## 🏗️ **What's Included**

### **1. Multi-Workspace Infrastructure (Terraform)**

#### **Core Components:**
- ✅ **2 Databricks Workspaces:**
  - **Primary Workspace** (Data Engineering) - For data ingestion and processing
  - **Analytics Workspace** (Data Science) - For ML and analytics
  
- ✅ **Shared Unity Catalog Metastore:**
  - Single metastore attached to both workspaces
  - Enables cross-workspace data sharing
  - Centralized governance and permissions

- ✅ **3 Databricks Clusters:**
  - Unity Catalog cluster (Primary workspace)
  - Shared cluster (Primary workspace)  
  - Analytics cluster (Analytics workspace)
  
- ✅ **SQL Warehouse** - For BI tool connectivity

- ✅ **Supporting Infrastructure:**
  - Storage Account (ADLS Gen2) for Unity Catalog
  - Key Vault for secrets
  - Managed Identity for secure access
  - Log Analytics for monitoring

> **Note**: This solution uses **public endpoints** for simplicity. For production deployments, consider adding VNet injection, private endpoints, and Network Security Groups.

### **2. Sample Notebooks (Python/SQL)**

#### **Notebook 1: Data Ingestion (Primary Workspace)**
**File:** `src/notebooks/01-data-ingestion-primary-workspace.ipynb`

**Purpose:** Create sample Delta tables in Unity Catalog

**What it does:**
- Creates 3 sample datasets (customers, products, transactions)
- Writes Delta tables to Unity Catalog: `shared_data.samples.*`
- Creates views for data lineage demonstration
- Demonstrates Delta Lake features

**Sample Data:**
- 10 customer records across multiple countries
- 10 product records with categories and pricing
- 12 transaction records with partitioning

#### **Notebook 2: Cross-Workspace Access (Analytics Workspace)**
**File:** `src/notebooks/02-cross-workspace-access-analytics.ipynb`

**Purpose:** Demonstrate accessing data from another workspace

**What it does:**
- Connects to `shared_data` catalog from Analytics workspace
- Queries tables created in Primary workspace
- Performs cross-table analytics and joins
