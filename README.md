# Azure Databricks with Unity Catalog - Terraform Infrastructure

This repository contains Infrastructure as Code (IaC) solutions for deploying Azure Databricks with Unity Catalog and comprehensive business continuity and disaster recovery capabilities.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The solution provides:
- **Multi-Workspace Architecture** - 2 Databricks workspaces (Data Engineering + Analytics)
- **Shared Unity Catalog** - Centralized governance across all workspaces
- **Cross-Workspace Data Sharing** - Zero data duplication, instant access
- **Complete Unity Catalog setup** with dedicated metastore and storage
- **Public endpoint deployment** for simplicity (VNet injection optional for production)
- **Managed identities** for secure storage access
- **Sample Notebooks** demonstrating Delta Lake and Unity Catalog features
- **Multi-environment support** (dev, staging, production)
- **Monitoring and governance** capabilities

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Azure CLI installed and configured
- Terraform >= 1.0
- Databricks Account ID (get from https://accounts.azuredatabricks.net/)

### Deployment
1. **Clone and navigate to infrastructure:**
   ```bash
   cd infra
   ```

2. **Configure your environment:**
   ```bash
   # Copy and customize the variables file
   cp terraform.tfvars terraform.tfvars.local
   # Edit terraform.tfvars.local with your settings
   ```

3. **Set your Databricks Account ID:**
   ```bash
   export TF_VAR_databricks_account_id="your-account-id-here"
   ```

4. **Deploy using the automated script:**
   ```bash
   # On Linux/Mac
   chmod +x deploy.sh
   ./deploy.sh deploy

   # On Windows
   .\deploy.ps1 deploy
   ```
